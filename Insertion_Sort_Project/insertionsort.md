# PROJECT 1
[**22**,27,16,**2**,18,6] -> İnsertion sort

## 1. Write the stages of the above sequence according to the sort type.
- [2,6,**16**,22,18,27]
- [2,6,16,**22**,**18**,27]
- [2,6,16,18,**22**,27]
- [2,6,16,18,22,27]

## 2. Write the Big-O notation.
- Insertion Sort -> O(n²)

## 3. Time Complexity: Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle, Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end, Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning of the series.
- Worst Case -> O(n²)
- Average Case -> O(n²)
- Best Case -> O(n)

## 4. What case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted? Write.
- Average Case

## Write the first 4 steps of [**7**,3,5,8,**2**,9,4,15.6] according to Insertion Sort.
-[2,3,**5**,8,7,9,**4**,15,6]
-[2,3,4,**8**,7,9,**5**,15,6]
-[2,3,4,5,**7**,9,8,15,**6**]
-[2,3,4,5,6,**9**,8,15,**7**]
